Imagine that you have an important tennis game soon. However, you decide not to practice for it. Then you have an excuse if you lose the game. This is an example of self-handicapping. When people self-handicap, they choose to act in a way that will hurt their performance. It gives them something to blame if they fail. And if they succeed, their achievement will be even more impressive. This behavior is quite common for students. For example, a student might decide not to study for a test. If they fail, they can say it’s because they didn’t study. And if they pass, their classmates will think they are really smart. It seems like a win-win situation. However, self-handicapping has negative consequences. For instance, it reduces your chances of success. And over time, it can cause you to consistently underachieve. So don’t be tempted to self-handicap. It’s always better to try your best.
